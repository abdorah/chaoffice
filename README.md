# ChaOffice Project Overview

## Introduction

ChaOffice is an ambitious desktop-first application suite designed to integrate multiple powerful tools into a single, intuitive interface. The project aims to streamline workflows for developers, analysts, and researchers by providing graphical user interfaces for command-line tools and data processing utilities.

## Project Vision

ChaOffice addresses the fragmentation of powerful yet disparate command-line utilities by presenting them in a cohesive, graphical, and user-friendly environment. The suite focuses on functionality over feature bloat, prioritizing ease of use and integration with existing workflows.

### Key Goals

1. **Integration**: Combine multiple tools (git, jq, sqlite3, Excel, markdown, PDF reporting, mailing, etc.) into one platform.
2. **Usability**: Deliver a desktop-first, intuitive interface for technical and non-technical users.
3. **Efficiency**: Enhance productivity by reducing the learning curve and automating workflows.
4. **Scalability**: Design a flexible architecture that supports future enhancements like cloud synchronization and AI-powered features.

## Core Components

1. **k-track**: Version control system based on git
2. **k-analysis**: JSON data querying tool powered by jq
3. **k-search**: SQL database management using sqlite3
4. **k-document**: Document generation and conversion using pandoc
5. **File Management**: Handling various file types, including Excel
6. **Reporting**: Markdown and PDF report generation
7. **Communication**: Email integration

## Technology Stack

- JavaFx with jlink and jpackge for native desktop development
- JDBC for local database management
- Apache POI for Excel file handling
- LibrePDF for PDF file handling
- Apache Camel for integration and workflow management
- Material Design 3 for UI/UX
- JGit for Git functionalities
- Pandoc for document generation and conversion

## Architecture and Design

### Modular Architecture

- Each tool (k-track, k-analysis, etc.) is developed as a separate module
- Shared core components for UI, settings, and data management
- Apache Camel as the central integration framework

### User Interface

- Material Design 3 for a modern, consistent look across all modules
- Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
- Dark mode support

### Data Flow

- Apache Camel routes for data processing and tool integration
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates

### Persistence

- SQLDelight for local data storage
- File-based storage for version control (git) and document management

## Key Features and Functionalities

1. **Unified Dashboard**: Overview of recent activities and quick access to tools
2. **Version Control (k-track)**: Git repository management with visual tools
3. **Data Analysis (k-analysis)**: Visual jq query builder and JSON visualization
4. **Database Management (k-search)**: Visual SQL query builder and data import/export
5. **Document Processing (k-document)**: Markdown editor, template management, and batch conversion
6. **File Management**: Central file browser with Excel support
7. **Reporting**: Customizable report builder with scheduling
8. **Communication**: Email client integration
9. **Workflow Automation**: Drag-and-drop workflow designer using Apache Camel

4. **Phase 4** (1 month): UI/UX polishing, onboarding flows, and customization features
5. **Phase 5** (2 months): Beta testing, feedback incorporation, and performance optimizations

## Success Metrics

- User adoption rate and active user growth
- User engagement metrics (daily active users, session duration)
- Community contributions (plugins, templates, bug reports)
- Performance benchmarks against individual tools

## Key Features

* **Data-Driven Approach:** The application is built with a strong emphasis on data management, using a well-defined database schema (PostgreSQL) and a RESTful API.
* **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** Supabase is used as the backend, providing a ready-to-use PostgreSQL database, authentication, and auto-generated API. This minimizes backend development efforts.
* **Multi-Platform Support:** The frontend is being developed as a web application, with plans to package it as a desktop application.
* **RESTful API:** The application uses a RESTful API, defined using the OpenAPI specification.
* **Authentication and Authorization:** The system includes a robust user management system with roles and permissions, managed through the database and API.
* **Row Level Security (RLS):** The database schema uses RLS for fine-grained control over data access.

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a multi-tiered architecture:

* **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed by Supabase)
* **Backend:** Supabase (providing RESTful API)
* **Frontend:** Desktop, web, mobile applications.

### Database Schema (SQL DDL)

The database schema consists of the following tables:

* **roles:** Stores user roles (e.g., administrator, manager, agent).
* **actors:** Stores user information, including name, email, phone, password, and role.
* **authorities:** Stores permissions (e.g., create\_order, view\_report).
* **actor\_authorities:** Associates actors with authorities.
* **categories:** Stores product categories (e.g., appetizers, main courses).
* **products:** Stores product information, including name, description, category, price, quantity, and image URL.
* **sites:** Stores site information (e.g., restaurant locations).
* **site\_actors:** Associates actors with sites.
* **zones:** Stores zone information within a site (e.g., dining area, bar).
* **sales:** Stores sale transaction data, including client, site, worker, zone, timestamp, and total price.
* **sale\_products:** Stores the products included in each sale.
